Summer 2014 Digital Humanities Course Development 

My summer 2014 open-access online course development for a course defined as an Introduction to Digital Humanities at Kent State University, in which I introduce myself to GitHub, seek to achieve high proficiency in GitHub as well as PanDocs and Vim to match my previous experience in scholarly editing with XML and the like, and generally try to bring my previous occassional work with such tools to a level of professional mastery, as preparation for inviting undergraduate students in humanities disciplines to move well beyond initial confusion and basic familiarity and toward competence in similar tools, all during in a one-semester course.

My source for these first steps in GitHub is "GitHub for Everyone" https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cq0eofr2J-Zn4x1HnrPLO9tmmTA3DN0HkvbWi7jA2EM/edit?pli=1 And my first model for PanDocs expertise at the moment is Caleb McDaniels' "Plain Text Note and Citation Management," on his blog at http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/plain-text-citations.html#fnref2.
