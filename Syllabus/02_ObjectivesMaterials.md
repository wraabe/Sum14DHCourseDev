##  Goals 

The goals for student learning in "ENG 39395, ST: Intro to Digital Humanities" are the following:

1.  To acquire basic digital literacy skills (text and image acquisition, text encoding, image processing, text processing) that undergird web-based technology;
2.  To become cognizant of the challenges of reproducing cultural artifacts and to become aware that some benefits of digitization, may risk damaging original artifacts or not fully representing some qualities of original documents;
3.  To develop project management and collaboration skills that are required for significant web-based projects;
4.  To develop interpersonal skills and communication techniques for addressing systematically and collaboratively the challenges that impede progress in group-based technology projects;
5.  To achieve awareness of the responsibilities that developers of public projects have for crediting sources and for ensuring access by diverse audiences;
6.  To develop a professional public identity that is associated with a web project and with associated class materials (blog posts and tweets) in publicly accessible online sites and forums.
