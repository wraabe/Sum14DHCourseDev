## Grading

  -------     --------------------------------
   30%        Blogs and Participation  
   20%        Paper                    
   20%        Interim Project Stages   
   30%        Final Group Project  
  -------     --------------------------------   

I grade all on-time assignments (blogs, papers, projects) within a week. I allow myself one extended grading period (extra week) for a major paper or project. If you miss class, please contact me about work returned during previous class. And please double-check grade entries on Blackboard. *Caution:* As a formal policy, if you earn a failing grade (below D- or 60\%) on major project and paper, you will automatically fail the course.
