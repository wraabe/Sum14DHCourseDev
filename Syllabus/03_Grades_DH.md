I grade all on-time assignments (papers, projects) within a week. When blog assignments are staggered (e.g., 4 students blog for each class period), I grade all blog posts within one week after a "set" is complete. I allow myself one extended grading period (extra week) for a major project. If you miss class, please contact me about work returned during previous class. And please double-check grade entries on Blackboard. *Caution:* As a formal policy, if you earn a failing grade (below D- or 60\%) on major project or paper, you will automatically fail the course.
