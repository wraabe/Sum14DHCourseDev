## Cheating and Plagiarism

By second week of class, I will post a Blackboard assignment in
which you affirm your familiarity with the university’s cheating and
plagiarism policy and in which sanctions for cheating and plagiarism are
described. You must complete the assignment before you can earn credit
for class submissions.

For a violation on a minor assignment---if you cheat or plagiarize on a
quiz, take-home assignment, or blog assignment---you will receive a
permanent zero on the assignment, one which will be calculated with the
final average even if another higher grade is dropped. For cases of
possibly inadvertent misrepresentations (citation omitted, quotation
presented as paraphrase), you will be reminded of the importance by a
deduction of one letter grade to the assignment. A second violation on a
minor assignment will be treated as a serious violation.

The following violations are treated as serious violations. If you cheat
or plagiarize on an exam or paper (proposal or draft or final) or if you
submit falsified information to avoid penalties for late submission, you
must submit a full non-plagiarized version capable of earning a grade of
“B.” But the grade you receive will be a “0.” If you fail to
fulfill the make-up requirement, you will automatically fail the course.
For cases of possibly inadvertent misrepresentations (citation page not
printed, quotation presented as paraphrase), you earn a permanent
deduction of one letter grade for the assignment.

I have generally found that detection of a single incident of plagiarism
requires further investigation of previous assignments. If I detect
plagiarism on one assignment, you will be asked to withdraw previous
assignments (grade changed to “0”) or resubmit them for review.

For one serious violation or two minor violations, I will forward the
evidence to the department chair, have the charge added to your record
with the college, recommend further judicial sanction, and pursue the
case during the appeals process. As plagiarism accusation procedures
require an opportunity for student to offer defense, plagiarism
accusations on final exam or final paper may result in a grade of
incomplete until procedure can be completed during the following
semester.

**Note**: The university faculty senate has recommended an option called
plagiarism school for the first incident in which a student is accused
of plagiarism. If this course is your first incident, I will recommend
you to “plagiarism school,” which will be required. If you have
previously been accused of plagiarism or have attended plagiarism school
before, you are not eligible for it and shall face consequences above.

**How Not to Plagiarize: ** Amanda French has offered helpful advice on
impermissible copying, especially actions that constitute
plagiarism and copyright violation. &lt;[http://digitalpast002.onmason.com/syllabus/](http://digitalpast002.onmason.com/syllabus/)&gt;:

 > If you are copying and pasting text that someone else wrote,
 > you might be plagiarizing. Pasted or manually retyped text is not plagiarized only
 > when all of the following three conditions are true: 1) the pasted text is
 > surrounded by quotation marks or set off as a block quote, and 2) the
 > pasted text is attributed in your text to its author and its source
 > (e.g., “As Jane Smith writes on her blog . . . ”), and 3) the pasted text is
 > cited in a footnote, endnote, and/or a bibliography (e.g., “Smith, Jane. Smith
 > Stuff. Blog. Available &lt;[http://smithstuff.wordpress.com](http://smithstuff.wordpress.com)&gt;
 > Accessed August 1, 2012.”) Conventions for copying and pasting computer code
 > are less strict, but even when you copy and paste code, if you can identify the
 > actual individual who wrote the code, you should give the coder's name and
 > the source of the code in a code comment. If you find and use images, audio,
 > or video on the web, you should also cite the creator (if known) and the 
 > source (at the very least) of that media file, usually in a caption as well
 > as in a footnote, endnote, or bibliography. Note that reproducing someone 
 > else's text, image, audio, or video file in full on your own public website
 > may constitute copyright infringement, even with proper attribution. 

That everyone violates formal copyright now or that techvangelists or corporate
shills on Twitter or YouTube or Facebook or Instagram or Pandora or Google endorse a culture of free
sharing of copyrighted content is not sufficient for you to escape
the consequences of plagiarism within this class. Times and laws change, but my demand
that you hold yourself to a high standard for ethical behavior is fully within
the realm of course policy. I am not qualified to give legal advice on copyright,
but I can advise sensible self-protection. When you post material on a public web site,
due diligence will help you defend yourself against claims of copyright infringement.
To exercise due diligence, see Cornell University's “Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States” &lt;[http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm](http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm)&gt;. Thoreau, who called for civil disobedience, spent the night in jail. 
If your violation of copyright is principled, I assume that failing a
college course assignment is a reasonable opportunity to test whether you are
truly devoted to your principles. If your copyright violations are clear
and in wanton disregard to guidelines, you will be assigned a failing grade
on assignment.
