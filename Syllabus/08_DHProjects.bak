According to the Modern Language Association Committee on Scholarly Editions,
"scholarly editions make clear what they promise and keep their promises." There
are five criteria according to which scholarly editions are evaluated:
accuracy, adequacy, appropriateness, consistency, and explicitness. 
I will aid you in choosing a project that is assumed to be manageable
over the course of the last six weeks of the semester. By regular communication 
and with my assistance (during review of proposals and interim project stages),
we will ensure that you develop reasonable claims about your intended project
and are confident that you can live up to those claims. At the end of the term,
when I review your project systematically, I expect to see both a 
subtantial amount of work, an accounting of the systematic procedures that
were used to establish accuracy and consistency in your work, and a clear
acknowledgment if portions of the anticipated or promised work
remain undone. A significant project on which substantial progress
has been acheived shall merit an A so long as statements about 
accuracy and adequacy of the final results match the statements about
procedure and principles in the introduction to the work.
