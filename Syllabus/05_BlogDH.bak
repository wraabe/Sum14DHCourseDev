## Blog Posts

You will contribute 4 to 5 blog posts of approximately 300 words
to the class blog. A blog post is your opportunity to build on in-class
discussion, to select IDs and Quotations for exams, and to contribute
your own observations. While blog posts need not observe the studied
formality of a paper, the blog post should exhibit proper spelling and
punctuation, its claims about the text should be supported by textual
citation as evidence, and it should conclude with a bibliographical
entry in a close approximation of MLA style. If you are assigned to
contribute a blog post, please publish the post within 24 hours of the
end of class. A handout will list requirements and suggestions for blog
posts. Blog posts can complement active in-class participation, and
ambitious blog posts can compensate entirely for minimal oral
participation in class. Blog assignments are submitted only in
electronic format.

At the start of the semester, I will allow full credit for blog
posts up to one class session late and will advise in class with
reminders on what a complete blog post requires: visit me during office
hours if you are having trouble. For your second and subsequent posts, I
will expect the posts to appear on time, within 24 hours of end of
class. I grade blog posts either at the end of the week or
after the entire set is complete. For late posts, I deduct
a letter grade. Posts more than one week late earn no credit.

Formal assignments (papers and assignments) are listed on syllabus
and posted on Blackboard. All formal assignments must be submitted both
as **print copies** and as **electronic copies** on Blackboard. You may
submit a word processor document in any of the following forms: Word DOC
or DOCX, Acrobat PDF, GoogleDoc, or Open Document. If submitting a
Google Doc, you may link to KSU Google Drive so long as you grant me
access to the document and do not alter it after the due date.
Presentations may be submitted as PowerPoint Document or Shows (PPT,
PPTX) or as Google Presentations or Prezi presentations. Paper-style
assignments must also be submitted as printed documents. 

**Formal assignments and papers submitted electronically via other means (such as
email) will not be accepted as on time nor will they be accepted for
credit. Submissions in non-designated proprietary formats (including
Apple Pages) will not be accepted for credit. You may request permission
to submit papers in alternate electronic format: if I
have or can locate non-proprietary free software to read the document, I
will accept them, provided you have requested and received approval before
submission. Corrupt file formats (invalid extensions, etc.) shall be construed
as missed assignments. **

### In-Class Participation

Participation during class-wide or small-group discussion is
preferred. A smaller number of high-quality contributions is valued more
than contributions of great quantity. A handout on the art of
Sprezzatura will list suggestions for developing high-quality in-class
contributions, which is also the model for informal blog writing.
Attendance and active in-class participation can complement (but not
substitute for) blog posts and assignments and quizzes.

### In-Class Quizzes

Short in-class quizzes (4–5 questions) may include questions to
review the reading and the lecture or discussion or activity
from the previous class. Quizzes will typically have at least 
one question on reading due for the current
class. The quiz will allow you to demonstrate that you recognize
characters, place names, plot events, and brief quotations from reading.
Spelling and quotation forms will always be from the required book.
If you miss a quiz because you are absent or late,
you will receive a grade of "0" on the quiz. In general, quizzes,
which are part of in-class participation, may not be made up if you are
absent or late, but see "Late Work and Extended Absences" below. I am
not a big fan of quizzes and will only use them if class participation
shows that a significant number of students are choosing to skip
reading.
