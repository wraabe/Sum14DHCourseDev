##  Goals 

The goals for students in "ENG 39395, ST: Intro to Digital Humanities"
are the following:

1.  To acquire basic digital literacy skills (text and image acquisition,
    text encoding, image processing, text processing) that undergird
    web-based technology
2.  To become cognizant of the challenges of reproducing cultural
    artifacts and to become aware that some benefits of digitization,
    such as access, depend on types of translation that include the
    risk of damaging original artifacts or of not fully representing
    some qualities of original documents;
3.  To develop project management and collaboration skills that are required
    for significant web-based projects;
4.  To develop interpersonal skills and communication techniques for 
    addressing systematically and collaboratively the challenges that impede 
    progress in group-based technology projects;
5.  To achieve awareness of the responsibilities that developers of 
    public projects have for crediting sources and for ensuring access
    by diverse audiences;
6.  To develop a professional public identity that is associated with
    a web project and with associated class materials (blog posts, tweets)
    in publicly accessible online sites and forums.
