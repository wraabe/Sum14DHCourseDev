## Group Presentations

For a group presentation (3 or 4 students presenting a series
of slides, but see full guidelines) you will choose an author and work
from the anthology that is **not** assigned on the syllabus. You will
present a 10-minute presentation (with slides) that explains the
significance of the author and work and how and why your chosen work could fit
within the parameters of the current course survey. Consider the following
questions: When and where was work written and/or published (must match
basic course parameters of geographical area, historical period, 
language---to extent that course is defined by such parameters in catalog)?  What is
the nature (genre) of the work?  What strikes you as important about 
the work and the writer? How is the work  similar to and/or different from
(thematically, historically, generically) other works that we have read
(or will read) in class?  The straightforward option is to select
for your presentation an author and work that is included in the
course-assigned anthology but is not assigned on the syllabus (to check whether
an author is assigned, search PDF syllabus for names). If unsure,
ask after selecting author and work but before preparing presentation.

## Exams

Two exams (IDs, quotations, essays) count toward 30% of your
grade. Essay questions will be provided before the exam: one or two
questions may be take-home, and one question will be answered in class.
If you must take an exam at an alternate time (i.e., excused absence for
illness, bereavement, or university activity), the substitute
exam may be identical to or different from the in-class exam, at my
discretion.

When an exam includes a take-home portion, a computer printed copy---not
an email message or a handwritten copy---is due in class. If you do not
have the printed copy at start of class, you can drop printed exam by the
envelope on my Satterfield 205c office within three hours after the end of
the exam. But you will receive a 20% deduction on that portion of exam.
If a handwritten answer is submitted for a take-home, you will receive a
20% deduction on that portion of the exam. These two deductions (late
and handwritten take-home) are cumulative.
