## Absences and Disruptions

You are permitted to miss the equivalent of up to 2 class sessions on
non-exam days with no formal penalty to your participation grade for the
absences, though you cannot make up in-class grades or activities. For no more than 2
absences, your “in-class participation” portion of your participation
grade will range from A to B+. For 3 or 4 absences, the “in-class
participation” portion of your participation grade will be calculated at
B- or C+. For 5 or 6 absences, C to D-. For 7 or more, a “0."

I will distinguish between excused and unexcused absences. To grant an
excused absence, I expect formal notification (email or voice mail
message) as soon as practicable. In the case of family matters or
serious illness, please send me a brief message as soon as practical.
For scheduled university activities, contact me BEFORE the expected
absence. So that I can arrange make-up exams or quizzes, please provide
a one-week notice prior to the absence. I respect your privacy. You need
not provide documentation in forms of doctor's excuse, death
certificate, etc. An email message in the following form qualifies an
absence as excused: “I need to attend to a health matter,” or “I
had to attend to a family matter.” Please also notify me when you expect to
return to class. I expect you to contact me at the earliest convenient
time: do not wait until day of your return to class.

**Extended Absences:** If you suffer an extended health matter or family
crisis---you miss more than a week---you may make up one quiz or turn in one
blog or assignment late without penalty. You will earn full credit for the
make-up. One set of extended absence dates (up to two weeks) for a
serious matter can be worked around during the first 10 weeks of the semester.
During late-semester, extended absences for a qualifying reason (death
in family, illness) may qualify you to seek an incomplete. If I do not receive
reasonably regular communication about a matter that you are attempting
to address (at least every two weeks), I will assume that you intend either to
withdraw, request incomplete, or to face grade consequence for excessive absences. 
Because of past experience with students who request extraordinary
assistance from professor in their effort to catch up after missing several
classes, I will only provide catch-up assistance after you have returned to
class and successully completed at least one missed assignment satisfactorily. Serious health or family catastrophes (more than 3 weeks) may qualify you to have a semester expunged from your record. For such matters, you should contact
your academic advisor or the student ombuds office, which will coordinate with your
professors. 

Keep disruptions to a minimum. Before class begins, silence or turn off
electronic devices (pager, phone, etc.). Conversations unrelated to
class should be held outside of class, and minimize communication (talk,
or text) that distracts you or others from class. Arrive in class on
time, and do not leave early. If you arrive more than ten minutes late
or leave before class is dismissed, expect to be counted absent. To
consult with the instructor, send an email, drop by during office hours,
or schedule an appointment.

## Maintaining Communication

Regardless of whether absences are excused or unexcused, you are
responsible for checking on Blackboard or class blog and to contact
classmates or group members to identify what you missed.
You are also advised to stop by during office hours or to
contact me by email to confirm what you missed. If
you schedule an office visit during my normal hours but are unable to
attend, please notify me at least 4 hours before the scheduled visit.
Office visits during my “by appointment" hours should always be
scheduled. If you schedule a by-appointment office visit outside of my
usual hours and miss the scheduled appointment, I will count it as
an absence.

In the case of an extended series of absences or an unexplained
absence on a major paper or project or exam date, you are required to
initiate a formal contact with the professor (email, office visit) to
reinstate yourself in the class. Any of the following three events
demand that you contact me: missing more
than two classes in a row, missing an exam, or missing a paper due date
and the following class. If you have not formally dropped and wish to
continue in course, an email of explanation and an office visit are
required within two days after returning to class. If during early semester
you miss more than three classes in a row or if you miss class
at a major due date (paper, exam) with no contact, I will file an
“early alert" on the campus notification system. If you miss multiple classes
or major due date late in the semester (weeks 10–15), I will contact
you once via email. If you do not respond promptly (within 48 hours), I will
assume that you intend to drop.  

## Summary
To maintain yourself in good class standing, it is not acceptable to
skip more than two classes in a row. To restore your standing
after missing three or more classes, I expect to return to class **and**
set up an office hour appointment. Sporadic good-faith efforts (a paper
in my mail box or on Blackboard, a cryptic email) may demonstrate
that you have a functioning conscience, but possession of a conscience is not
a substitute for class attendance and for submitting assignments and
for taking exams on proper due date.
