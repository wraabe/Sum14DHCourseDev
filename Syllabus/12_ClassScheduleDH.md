## Week 3: Form and content

How does one distinguish between form (the technological underpinnings or matters of presentation) and content (the stuff for interpretation)? If we suppose we can distinguish between form and content, is that a useful step, or are we likely to deceive ourselves by taking such distinctions for granted? Could the distinction between form and content be both useful for some purposes and deceptive for others? We will explore this question by preparing a document in Markdown format, which will then be converted to forms suitable for alternate means of publication: print document, blog, and ebook.

## Week 5: Acquiring Texts

When working with humanities material, we often need to acquire text. While many documents are available online, in some cases, the text that we need to acquire are not. For our final project, with archival letters, we are the ones who plan to make them available to others. Therefore, we want to be familiar with automated techniques to acquire text. We shall also gain a greater familiarity with some qualities of archival materials, which are often viewed as "faulty" or "inadequate" for machine processing. We continue our concern with whether there is a useful distinction between the form of archival documents and their linguistic content.
