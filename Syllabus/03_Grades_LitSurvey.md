## Grading
------------ | -------------
  20\% |  Blogs, Assignments, In-Class Participation, and Quizzes
  20\% |  Paper 1 at 4--5 pgs. with proposal and final draft
  30\% |  Paper 2 at 7--8 pgs. with proposal, workshop, and final draft
  30\% |  Exams

I grade and return all on-time assignments (quizzes, assignments, exams, papers) within a week. When blog assignments are staggered (e.g., 4 students blog for each class period), I grade all blog posts within one week after a "set" is complete. I allow myself one extended grading period (extra week) for a quiz, blog set, or exam. If you miss class, please contact me about work returned during previous class. And please double-check grade entries on Blackboard. *Caution:* As a formal policy, if you earn a failing grade (below D- or 60\%) on two or more papers or exams, you will automatically fail the course.
