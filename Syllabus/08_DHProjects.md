## Digital Humanities Projects

According to the Modern Language Association Committee on Scholarly Editions, “scholarly editions make clear what they promise and keep their promises” (*Electronic Textual Editing* 23). The same advice is fitting for electronic projects. Five criteria are used to evaluate scholarly editions: accuracy, adequacy, appropriateness, consistency, and explicitness (23). I will aid you in choosing a project that is assumed to be manageable over the course of the last several weeks of the semester. By regular communication and with my assistance (during review of proposals and interim project stages), we will ensure that you develop reasonable claims about your intended project and are confident that you can live up to those claims. At the end of the term, when I review your project systematically, I expect to see a  substantial amount of work, an explicit accounting of procedures that were used to establish accuracy and consistency in your work, and a clear acknowledgment if portions of the anticipated or promised work remain undone.
