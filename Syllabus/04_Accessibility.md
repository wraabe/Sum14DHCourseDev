# Accessibility Statement

My aim is for course content to be available to all students.
Students who have a documented disability may need reasonable
accommodations to participate fully in this class. Even if you do not have a
documented disability, some materials that I provide may present
challenges. For example, I tend to rely on handouts or posted
instructions to spell out detailed requirements on assignments.
If that means for absorbing information is challenging to you,
you are welcome to stop by my office hours to discuss.
Many of the basic university services that are available to all
students in this class---office hours, library reference desk, writing center,
departmental advising, psychological services---are available to you on
an as-needed basis without formal documentation.

In the case of a formally designated “documented disability,” adjustments
that alter course policies or procedures to make the course more
accessible to one student may result in different course policies
for different students---and that's fine. I and other professors
have varied policies in different classes according to number of
students, pedagogical aim of class, etc. So the legally defined standard of
“reasonable accommodation” is a sensible burden for a professor
to assume in order to ensure the greater value of accessibility---because
the burden that a professor assumes to provide alternate options for
accessibility is no greater than what students bear when professors have
different policies. However, for you to receive an accommodation---for me to alter
general syllabus policy on your individual behalf---university policy requires that
you complete the paperwork to verify that you have a “documented
disability.” And you must complete the paperwork at the start of the
semester to verify your eligibility. Therefore, to ensure that you
receive the accommodation to which you have a right, **you must first
verify your eligibility for these through Student Accessibility
Services** (contact 330-672-3391 or visit

registration procedures). Consult legalistic details for all university
