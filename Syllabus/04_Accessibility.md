## Accessibility Statement

My aim is for course content to be available to all students. Students who have a documented disability may need reasonable accommodations to participate fully in this class. Even if you do not have a documented disability, some materials that I provide may present challenges.  Many of the basic university services that are available to all students in this class---office hours, library reference desk, writing center, departmental advising, psychological services---are available to you on an as-needed basis without formal documentation.

In the case of a formally designated “documented disability,” alterations of course policies or procedures to make the course more accessible to one student may result in different course policies for different students---and that's fine. I and other professors have varied policies in different classes according to number of students, pedagogical aim of class, etc. So the legally defined standard of “reasonable accommodation” is a sensible burden for a professor to assume in order to ensure the greater value of accessibility---because the burden that a professor assumes to provide alternate options for accessibility is no greater than what students bear when professors have different policies. However, to receive an accommodation---to customize class syllabus policy on your individual behalf---university policy requires that you complete the paperwork to verify that you have a “documented disability.” You must complete the paperwork at the start of the semester to verify eligibility. To ensure that you receive the accommodation to which you have a right, **you must first verify your eligibility for these through Student Accessibility Services** (contact 330-672-3391 or visit &lt;[www.kent.edu/sas](www.kent.edu/sas)&gt; for more information on registration procedures).
