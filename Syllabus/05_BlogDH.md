## Blog Posts

You will contribute 4 to blog posts of approximately 400--500 words to the class blog. A blog post is an opportunity to build on in-class discussion and to contribute your own observations. Blog posts need not observe the studied formality of a paper, but you should should exhibit proper spelling and punctuation, and MLA citation style. Blog assignments are submitted only in electronic format (no paper copy is required).

Formal papers are listed on syllabus and posted on Blackboard or course web site. All formal assignments must be submitted both as **print copies** and as **electronic copies** on Blackboard. A paper-style document in word processor document may be in any of the following file formats: MS Word DOC or DOCX, Adobe Acrobat PDF, GoogleDoc, or Open Document (Apache OpenOffice, WordPerfect, LibreOffice, OpenOffice, etc.). If submitting a Google Doc, you may link to KSU Google Drive so long as you grant me access to the document and do not alter it after the due date. 

Formal papers submitted electronically via other means (such as email) will not be accepted as on time nor will they be accepted for credit. Submissions in non-designated proprietary formats (including Apple Pages) will not be accepted for credit. You may request permission to submit papers in alternate electronic format: if I have or can locate non-proprietary free software to read the document, I will accept them, provided you have requested and received approval before submission. Corrupt file formats (invalid extensions, etc.) shall be construed as missed assignments.
