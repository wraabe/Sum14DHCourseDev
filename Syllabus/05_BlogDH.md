## Blog Posts

You will contribute 4 to blog posts of approximately 500--750 words to the class blog. Each blog will have a prompt. A blog post is an opportunity to build on in-class discussion and to contribute your own observations, and I recommend for full credit that you engage in additional research or reading. Blog posts need not observe the studied formality of a paper, but you should should exhibit proper spelling and punctuation, and MLA citation style. Blog assignments are submitted only in electronic format: no paper copy is required.
