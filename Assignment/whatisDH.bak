# Digital Humanities: What is it?

Our first course project is a collaboratively authored document entitled, "A Student Project: What is Digital Humanities?" The surface rhetorical purpose of this assignment is to engage with one another in regard to public definitions of digital humanities. All students will contribute to that effort, first, by reading assigned articles and blog posts, by writing a blog post, and by responding to one or two posts by other students. After the initial discussion is offered and revised in response to recommendations from other readers in the class, the class's second effort will engage in a collaborative process with the aim of sharing that discussion with the public. Our ostensible purpose is to share the "same" content, half of the class discussion (we will break class into two groups), in three distinct publication forms: a public blog, a print document, and an ebook. You will both be challenged to use free open-access tools that can make this collaborative project workable (Markdown language, GitHub repository, Pandoc document converter, Zotero, WordPress and either LaTeX or Calibre) and you shall be encouraged to think about the degree to which choosing a publication form (a blog, a print document, an ebook) should shape the way a document is created and published. 

Is there such a thing as one ring to rule them all? Can students form a temporary fellowship in which Markdown, the language for simple document formatting, and Pandoc, the conversion tool, manage the magic ring effectively? More prosaically, can one  team of 12, work effectively to publish an extended document (over 20 pages) in multiple forms without walking all over one another. Furthermore, we distinguish our own personal frustrations with learning a new technology from the limitations that are characteristic of publication forms? Do some publication technologies lend themselves to certain types of document features (citation, links, keywords, commenting) that are more difficult or perhaps even pointless when presenting the "same" content with another publication technology? Is a distinction between form (accident of being published online or in print form) and content (essential part of words and ideas) liberating and useful or constricting and misleading?

I should announce that the my choice to require you to use open access tools has elements of ideological leanings, pedagogical usefulness, and, hopefully, practical benefit for your future employment.  So, for example, you could collaborate and put together most of same document formats with a combination of DropBox, Google Drive, Microsoft Word, and Scrivener. But it is more in keeping with the ethic of digital humanities to assume that the initial challenge of learning open access tools will prove rewarding, that you will encounter alternate ways of thinking about what documents are. The open access tools tend to force you to put yourself into control of the documents and not rely on software vendor choices. Finally, I worked as a technical writer for over a decade, so I can with some confidence believe that you that your ability to adapt to alternate corporate cultures and documentation methods has the potential to improve your employment opportunities.  To know various methods of document management---and be able to make recommendations or adapt either as a documentation manager or project manager---is a far more valuable set of skills than knowing the one software program that a company or organizations currently uses to produce documents. 

Each student's individual contribution to this assignment will consist of the following parts: 

1.	Each student will offer a formal response to one or more of the readings during the first two weeks of the course. The response will consist of a 2- to 3-page (500--700 words) blog post, with a thesis that engages one or more of the following general topics:
     -  digital humanities as a threat to literary studies [@kirsch2014; @marche2014].
     -  digital humanities as a set of institutional sites of study and professional organizations [@kirschenbaum2010]
     -  digital humanities as building things, such as computer applications, models, and online projects [@ramsay2011]
     -  digital humanities as sharing, developing a community [@sample2011] 
     -  digital humanities as productive unease, grappling with tension between ideas of technological progress and the recognition that humanities research materials resist modeling and processing [@flanders2009]
2.  Each blog post must have at least one formal citation of another piece of writing, either from list above or from another blog post or article.
3.  By Monday of week 3, each student's original blog post, which shall be written using Markdown language, will be posted  on the class's Markdown-enabled blog AND shared on the class's  GitHub repository.
4.  By Wednesday of week 3, each student shall respond, at  least twice, to two other students' blog posts. Each  response must refer to a specific passage or idea in the student's post and compare or contrast with another idea from another student's post or from the assigned reading (i.e., quote from and cite source). The response posts should be posted on the Markdown-enabled blog.

After initial posts are complete, the class shall be split into two 12-person teams, and each team shall be split into 4 3-person groups.  Each team shall have the following four groups: 1) editorial working group, 2) print working group, 3) public blog working group, and 4) ebook working group. For all of  the remainder of the work, you are encouraged to collaborate with other members of your team (inside your group and outside), and you are encouraged to collaborate with the corresponding group on the other team to manage or troubleshoot any  difficulties that you encounter. Whenever possible, please work together (in reserved library room, at same computer, with online collaboration tool) to achieve solutions to problems. 

5.  During week 3, the both editorial working groups (one for each team) shall create a  GitHub fork for its 12 team member's original blog posts. They shall, based on commentary received on the blog, recommend corrections and revisions to posts. Furthermore, the editorial group by end of week shall organize the student contributions (section headings and introductions, shared bibliography), and shall provided editorial approve of the final project for  publication. When the other teams do their work during week 4, the editorial group shall remain responsive and accommodate revisions to GitHub repository documents to better serve needs of print, blog, or ebook team.
6.  During week 4, each print working group (one for each team) shall use Pandoc to convert blog posts from its team members to a printed LaTeX document (report or article in PDF format) that gathers all student contributions (including those by editorial team) and has a shared bibliography for all citations. The final product should be based on the most current and updated GitHub fork.
7.  During week 4, both public blog working groups shall develop an independent public blog of all group posts with keywords and citations. The final product should be based on the most current and updated GitHub fork.
8.  During week 4, both ebook working groups shall use Calibre to generate an ebook in ePub format and publish the book on Google Books. The final product should be based on the most current and updated GitHub fork.

At every stage, students are encouraged to raise the bar above minimal assignment requirements.  Ask yourself, for example, would post or printed document benefit from a table of contents or index? Should blog posts have keywords? Should contributor notes be published also? To earn full credit for excellence, you need to raise the bar.

*General Notes:* I encourage an iterative process. Test procedures to see if they work.  Try to do everything, but develop reasoned processes to scale back ambitions if it becomes overwhelming. The final step of  the process will be a personal reflection on collaboration in the assignment (500 words), which will be posted on the course blog.

## Group requirements

### Editorial Working Group

Your group is responsible for consistency of citation and formatting. Revise and mark up individual posts for revision. Maintain control over the source Markdown documents in GitHub.  Review and return posts with editorial markup by Tuesday. I recommend converting Pandoc to RTF and using Word or Google Docs to  return posts with marginal commentary to students. After writers make their edits (either on GitHub source or Word or Google Docs that you send---you decide which procedure works best), it is your final review that provides consistency of formatting style and editorial style. 

Using a shared Zotero library, create a shared citation folder with one citation entry for each file. A sample Zotero library group folder for the "What Is DH?" assignment has been placed at the following location:  [https://www.zotero.org/groups/274025](https://www.zotero.org/groups/274025 ).  If not accessible, send me a reminder. I will open group membership in Zotero library to all students.

The job of the editorial working group is to ensure that all are cited consistently and that no citations are duplicated. When the Zotero library is consistent, other working groups will need to export the .bib file from the Zotero library to create a bibliography.  Place the bibliography (.bib) in the GitHub repository with revised markdown documents. 

### Print Working Group

For the print working group, you must use Pandoc and LaTeX to generate a PDF and a printed document. The print working group shall use all approved editorial posts to create a print document. The initial method for creating the document shall be as follows:

1.  Install Pandoc and LaTeX for your operating system. 
2.  After the editorial working group's work is complete,  use GitHub to download the final updates of blog posts and bibliography (but do test with sample date from GitHub before attempting the final version).
3.  Review the following routines for managing elaborate Pandoc documents (multiple files with citations).

    -  Managing Multiple files in markdown. [https://github.com/akmassey/markdown-multiple-files-example](https://github.com/akmassey/markdown-multiple-files-example )  
    - Adding name of the .bib file to YAML metadata block. [http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example19/YAML-metadata-block.html](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example19/YAML-metadata-block.html )
    - Using citations in Pandoc (you will be using BibLaTeX [http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example19/Citations.html](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example19/Citations.html )
    - Setting up appropriate Citation Style Language in GitHub, which you add to Pandoc file directory. [https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles ). The Chicago style names begin with "chicago-". The Modern Language Association style names begin with "modern-language-".  Place them in main document file folder for convenience.
    - Download the default.latex template, and place it in the main document file folder for convenience.  [https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates/blob/master/default.latex](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates/blob/master/default.latex ).

After the setup is complete, see the Pandoc documentation for instructions on generating LaTeX document from Markdown with bibliography.  You may use the default LaTeX format for Pandoc, or you may wish to change the settings on the default template. 

Depending on conversion settings, Pandoc may embed the bibliographical information in the document as text (from the .bib source). Or you can use LaTeX to generate the bibliography with BibLaTeX (from the .bib source).  To generate a bibliography from within LaTeX, you must run LaTeX, then run BibTeX, and then run LaTeX twice more.

Below are some design recommendations to consider:

  - The default Pandoc template for LaTeX documents may be adequate, but you may want to consider adapting the default template or by manually altering the template. One dissatisfaction that new users often feel is with margins. For information on page layout, see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Page_Layout](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Page_Layout ).
 -  After Pandoc generates your LaTeX document, you may want to consider uploading the document to an shared LaTeX editor, on which you can collaborate for your LaTeX design. The two that I would recommend you consider are [http://www.authorea.com](http://www.authorea.com ) and [https://www.sharelatex.com/](https://www.sharelatex.com/). Do note that default for both these tools is to only allow one collaborator at a time for free accounts, though Authorea says it allows two. 

### Public Blog Working Group

For the public blog working group, you must set up a public server, install WordPress, and install a Markdown plugin. 

*Note:* One person in your group, the Administrator, will need to  sign up for and pay for a Reclaim Hosting account. The price is \$25 for one year of hosting. For final project, I will ask one member from each group to sign up for an account. At that time, you will be asked to settle up financially with person who has registered for the Reclaim Hosting account, and we will discuss policies for preserving your own content later in the course.
  
1.  (Administrator Only): Purchase a domain from [www.reclaimhosting.com](www.reclaimhosting.com ), a \$25 annual subscription. 
2.  (Administrator Only): Install WordPress on your domain,        [http://portal.reclaimhosting.com/knowledgebase.php?action=displayarticle&id=2](http://portal.reclaimhosting.com/knowledgebase.php?action=displayarticle&id=2 ).
3.  (Administrator): In consultation with fellow members of your working group, create a URL and title for blog that offers approximate representation of assignment question (that is, no "adorablekittens.com").
4.  (Administrator): Invite other students to your blog as administrators. On Users menu, click "Add Users," and invite other members of the Public Blog Working Group via their official Kent State address. For Role, select "Administrator." 

The person who set up the Reclaim Hosting account with steps above is the Administrator of the domain. Those who are invited in Step 4 are set up as administrators of the WordPress account. Subsequent steps may be performed by anyone in work group who has an Administrator account in WordPress, so all subsequent steps should be performed collaboratively. 

1.  When logged into WordPress as an Administrator, select Plugins menu and search for "JetPack." Install it.   
2.  After Jetpack appears in your list of plugins, click Activate.
3.  On the Jetpack menu item, click "Get Started" and "Authorize Jetpack." 
4.  Create a test post with markdown language (you may need to log out and log back into the blog). For details on the flavor of Markdown that is supported, see [http://jetpack.me/support/markdown/](http://jetpack.me/support/markdown/ ).
5.  When GitHub repository is updated with revised blog posts, develop a procedure to publish posts on your blog. Please try Markdown, but you have the option to decide against Markdown should it prove unworkable (uninstall JetPack).

Below are some design recommendations to consider:

  -  What should home page of blog look like? Should certain posts be more prominent than others---such as most recent first? Or should you select a design that places equal weight regardless of when post published? Do consider difference between the "page" and the "post".
  -  Should documentation (works cited) be associated with individual posts, or should entire blog have a shared bibliography? Which makes more sense to user, Chicago style notes and bibliography or MLA-style parenthetical references? Can you use Pandoc to generate bibliography or notes? Is Markdown the best way to format posts, or could you use Pandoc to generate another format, like HTML, that would work better?
  -  For student posts that refer to other student posts on the same blog, can you devise a standard system for cross-referencing between posts, such as a naming convention for blogs that can be used also in cross-references?
  -  Could your blog be better with information in the About section or other widgets? Might you promote blog on Twitter or Facebook?
  -  Would tags or keywords offer a better means of sorting posts into groups?

   
### EBook Working Group

As you will read on [http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/make-your-own-e-books-with-pandoc/39067](this ProfHacker post) from Lincoln Mullen, creating an eBook is "almost trivially easy." Therefore, as the ebook working group, you have the special responsibility of improving the quality of the final product beyond the source documents.

Below are the basic steps that Mullen recommends, revised to emphasize our class documents.

1.  Download the updated GitHub versions of the blog posts. 
2.  Review the following routines for managing elaborate Pandoc documents (multiple files with citations): managing Multiple files in markdown. [https://github.com/akmassey/markdown-multiple-files-example](https://github.com/akmassey/markdown-multiple-files-example ).
3.  Create a title page named `title.txt` and a copyright page named `metadata.xml`.
4.  Using Pandoc, stitch all the document parts together. 
5.  Publish the ebook
