# Digital Humanities: What is it?

Our first course project is a collaboratively authored document
entitled, "A Student Project: What is Digital Humanities?" Each
student's individual contribution to this assignment will consist of the
following parts: 
1.   Each student will offer a formal response to one or more
     of the readings during the first two weeks of the course.
     The response will consist of a 2- to 3-page (500--700 words)
     blog post, with a thesis that engages one or more of the
     following general topics:
     -  digital humanities as a threat to literary studies [see @kirsch2014; also @marche2014].
     -  digital humanities as a set of institutional sites
        of study and professional organizations [see @kirschenbaum2010]
     -  digital humanities as building things, such as computer applications,
        models, and online projects [see @ramsay2011]
     -  digital humanities as sharing, developing a community [see @sample2011] 
     -  digital humanities as productive unease, grappling with tension
        between ideas of technological progress and the recognition that humanities
	    research materials resist modeling and processing [see @flanders2009]
2.  Each blog post must have at least one formal citation of another piece
    of writing, either from list above or from another blog post or article.
3.  By Monday of week 3, each student's original blog post, which
    shall be written using Markdown language, will be posted 
    on the class's Markdown-enabled blog AND shared on the class's 
    GitHub repository.
4.  By Wednesday of week 3, each student shall respond, at 
    least twice, to two other students' blog posts. Each 
    response must refer to a specific passage or idea
    in the student's post and compare or contrast with another idea from
    another student's post or from the assigned reading (i.e., quote
    from and cite source). The response posts should be posted on
    the Markdown-enabled blog.

After initial posts are complete, the class shall be split into two 12-person
teams, and each team shall be split into 4 3-person groups. 
Each team shall have the following four groups:
1) editorial working group, 2) print working group, 3) public blog working group,
and 4) ebook working group. For all of  the remainder of the work,
you are encouraged to collaborate with other
members of your team (inside your group and outside), and you
are encouraged to collaborate with the
corresponding group on the other team to manage or troubleshoot any 
difficulties that you encounter. Whenever possible, please
work together (in reserved library room, at same computer, with online
collaboration tool) to achieve solutions to problems. 

5.  During week 3, the both editorial groups (one for each team)
    shall create a  GitHub fork for its 12 team member's original blog posts.
    They shall, based on commentary
    received on the blog, recommend corrections and revisions
    to posts. Furthermore, the editorial group by end of week
    shall organize the student contributions
    (section headings and introductions, shared bibliography), and
    shall provided editorial approve of the final project for 
    publication. When the other teams do their work during week 4,
    the editorial group shall remain responsive and accommodate revisions
    to GitHub repository documents to better serve needs of print, blog, or ebook team.
6.  During week 4, both print working group shall use pandoc
    to convert blog posts from its team members to a printed
    LaTeX document (report or article in PDF format)
    that gathers all student contributions (including those by editorial team)
    and has a shared bibliography for all citations. The final product
    should be based on the most current and updated GitHub fork.
7.  During week 4, both public blog working group shall
    develop an independent public blog of all group posts with keywords
    and citations. The final product
    should be based on the most current and updated GitHub fork.
8.  During week 4, both ebook groups shall use
    Calibre to generate an ebook in ePub format and publish the book
    on Google Books. The final product
    should be based on the most current and updated GitHub fork.

At every stage, students are encouraged to raise the bar above minimal assignment requirements. Ask yourself, for example,  would post or printed document benefit from a table of contents or index? Should blog posts have keywords? Should contributor notes be published also? 

Final notes: I encourage an iterative process. Test things to see if they work. 
Try to do everything, but developed reasoned processes to scale back ambitions
if it becomes overwhelming. The final step of the process will be a personal
reflection on collaboration in the assignment (500 words), which will be posted
on the course blog.
