## Digital Humanities: What is it?

Our first course project is a collaboratively authored document
entitled, "A Student Project: What is Digital Humanities?" Student
contributions to this assignment will consist of multiple parts,
under the following headings: 
1.   Each student will offer a formal response to one or more
     of the readings during the first two weeks of the course.
     The response will consist of a 2- or 3-page (500--700 words)
     blog post, with a thesis that engages one or more of the
 	 following general topics:
     -  digital humanities as a threat to literary studies
     -  digital humanities as building things, computer applications,
        models, and online projects
     -  digital humanities as sharing, developing a community
     -  digital humanities as productive unease, grappling with tension
        between ideas of technological progress and sense that humanities
	    research materials resist modeling
2.	Each blog post must have at least one formal citation of another piece
    of writing, a blog post or an article.
3.  By the start of week 3, each student's original blog post, which
    shall be written using Markdown language, will be posted 
	on the class's Markdown-enabled blog AND on the class's shared
	GitHub repository.
4.  Students shall be split into two groups, each having 4 3-person
    teams: 1) editorial team, 2) print team, 3) blog team, and 4) ebook team.
5.  During week 3 editorial team shall provide editorial commentary
	and revision suggestions on other student posts (from all members of
	its group), shall write an introduction to the overall 
    group project, shall organize the student contributions
	(section headings and introductions, shared bibliography), and
	shall provided editorial approve of the final project for 
	publication. The editorial team shall also adjudicate
	conflicting recommendations by
	other project teams to accommodate revisions to GitHub repository
	documents to better serve needs of print, blog, or ebook team.
6.  Each print team shall (in addition to providing their own posts) use pandoc
	to convert blog posts to a printed LaTeX document (report, article)
	that gathers all student contributions (including those by editorial team)
	and has a proper bibliography for all citations.
7.  Each public blog team shall (in addition to providing their own posts) develop
	an independent public blog of all group posts with keywords and citations.
8.  Each ebook team shall (in addition to providing their own posts) use
    Calibre to generate an ebook in ePub format and publish the book
	on Google Books. (https://www.lib.umn.edu/faq/22714)
