# Acquiring and Visualizing Texts

Our second course project, again collaborative, will be to explore ways of acquiring digital texts and ways of visualizing them.  We could assume that most texts that we want are already available online, but that would be a mistake. More recently published texts, which are still in copyright, may not be available or may only be available in a form in which we cannot copy and paste or grab the text. Therefore, if we want to analyze or visualize a text, we may need to acquire the text either by using optical character recognition software or (god forbid) by transcribing a text manually. In some cases, such as handwritten letters that have not been published, manual transcription may be the best choice. But it is also true that a text we find online may not be reliable: it could be abridged (shortened) or censored. One of the suggestions for this exercise is to become better aware of how access and visualization, which seem to offer useful and straightforward technological shortcuts to higher orders of interpretation, are themselves highly subjective procedures. 

In this project, we are going to analyze Louisa May Alcott's *Hospital Sketches* to see how tools for visualization can help us devise interpretive readings. That is, we're going to consider what texts are publicly available and how we might visualize them. And then we're going to see how we can improve the quality of our work by being more conscientious and systematic. One version of the text, which was published initially in a Boston newspaper, is not presently available online. So we're going to test methods for acquiring it, including OCR and transcription. Don't worry: we'll break up the work so no one person has to do too much.  

These are the basic processes about which we will gain basic competence during this three-week project:

  -  Acquiring an online version of a text and using systematic methods (text comparison and REGEX) to improve the quality of the transcription.
  -  Developing sensible procedures for determining what counts as significant and normalizing a text according to those procedures
  -  Using methods to establish likely provenance (source) for a text that lacks identifying information about its origin
  -  Visualizing texts with concordances, word clouds, and text comparison tools to correct and to display differences
  -  Using OCR to acquire a text
  -  Using transcription to acquire a text
  -  Analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of visualization to support interpretive readings
  
 ## Step 1
 
 When Alcott's publisher Roberts Brothers told her that they wanted to publish a new version of *Hospital Sketches* and some of her war stories, they requested some changes. She described the changes that Roberts Brothers requested in her journal: "Arranged 'Hospital Sketches and War Stories' for a book. By taking out all Biblical allusions, and softening all allusions to rebs, the book may be made 'quite perfect,' I am told. Anything to suit the customers" (*Journals* 164). According to the work by a recent scholar Ruth Berman, Alcott (or her publisher) also "cut out most allusions to liquor" ('Spirituous Consolation' 184). Our first task is to see whether we can acquire the two versions of the text, to review them for obvious errors, and to use REGEX to correct them. When correcting a text, it is often easy to assume a pattern is predictable. And often it is. But errors in our REGEX expression or an unanticipated inconsistency may lead to errors.  Therefore, it will be important to be systematic and keep a copy of the original record and of each significant revision---because errors in our processes may require us to go back to a previous version and repeat our work.
 
1.  Download the Redpath version (1863) of *Hospital Sketches* from the Internet Archive at the following address: [https://archive.org/details/hospitalsketches00alcorich](https://archive.org/details/hospitalsketches00alcorich). The easiest method is to select the "Full Text" option and drag with cursor from top to bottom until all is selected. Using your favorite text editor, save it into a clearly labeled folder, such as `LMA_HospSketches` as a plain text document in UTF 8. Label it clearly as the initial version with file name, such as `LMAHS_Redp63_InetArc_FullText_ver1.txt.`
 
 
 ##  The second step is to analyze the quality of the acquired texts to see whether they will serve our purposes or whether we need to perform additional steps to clean them up. 

 
 
 
 
 
 ## Step 4?
 Because Alcott's journal statement has been known, most classroom editions print the 1863 version as the less censored Civil War text.  But there is also an earlier version of the story, which was published in a Boston newspaper *The Commonwealth* during the war. We know that the newspaper version is shorter because in the "Publisher's Advertisement" the sketches are described as "revised and enlarged" (5).
