## General Tips
  1. In past 3 years, modern OS releases have added hurdles
     if you seek to install software from non-approved vendors.
     The warnings typically invoke viruses or security concerns.
     Open-source software, generally maintained by academics,
     has been around longer, relies on volunteer labor, and
     is not going to start jumping through vendor hoops. Therefore,
     when installing open source software, you may be warned
     or forced to take extra steps. 
  2. To install software, you must have an administrator
   account on your computer. And you must also be logged in 
   as the administor when installing. In Windows, especially, you may
   be required to install or run software in administrator mode. 
  3. Much open-source software will be available through GitHub
   or SourceForge and sometimes on web sites that look dicey to
   you because they still employ frames and fonts out of 1990s.
   SourceForge is a private company, and it may try to take advantage of newbie users.
 [SourceForge Warning](http://www.gluster.org/2013/08/how-far-the-once-mighty-sourceforge-has-fallen/ "SourceForge Warning")
   I will try to warn you of potential pitfalls, but I 
   encourage you to warn one another if you encounter problems.
   One risk is that by end of course, 90s-style web sites with no dancing graphics
   may seem kind of cool to you. 
   GitHub is generally more widely used today.
  4. Likewise, open source UNIX-based software may have less support for mouse,
     may demand whole arsenal of arcane commands, may have
     minimal availability of handholding tutorials,
     and offer almost no immediate rewards during first hours of use,
     first days of use, or even first weeks of use. That is, expect 20 hours of
     struggle to reach minimal competence. Ask me about how long it
     took to achieve basic competence with LaTeX, PanDoc, Vim Text Editor, GitHub,
     etc. 
  5. Operating Systems:
  * Apple Macintosh, you should be on Snow Leopard, Snow Lion,
    or Maverick. You may install UNIX-based software on Macintosh, which
    has been a UNIX OS for several years.
  * MS Windows, you should be on Windows 7 or later. Windows XP or
    Vista are not supported.
  * UNIX implementations like Ubuntu, Red Hat for laptop or
    desktop system. Any modern UNIX implementation should work fine. But
    you're on your own, like always.
  * Apple or Android Tablets, Google Chrome, etc. I have no
    recommendations for OS-level hacking, emulation, dual boot modes, etc.
    In the end, I am still an English professor.  
  5. I will try to help, but I am not a substitute for trained
     computer troubleshooters or technicians. For software,
     contact [KSU HelpDesk](http://support.kent.edu "KSU Helpdesk"). For
     virus and compenent repair, contact [KSU TechSpot](http://www2.kent.edu/is/support/thetechspot/index.cfm "The TechSpot").
