# Intro to DH Software Advice (Install, Usage, General Tips)

## General Tips
  1. In past 3 years, modern operating system (OS) releases have added hurdles
     if you seek to install software from non-approved vendors.
     The warnings typically invoke viruses or security concerns.
     Designers of free and open-source software, generally academics,
     seldom want to jumping through OS vendor hoops, because
     the work on software is not for-profit and because many
     people who do the work on software have other jobs.
 2.  Much important open-source software was designed originally for
     servers and UNIX operating system. The maintenance of the software
     generally relies on volunteer labor or donations. When such software is "ported"
     over to Windows or Macintosh, the installation routines
     may be bare-bones. Therefore, your OS may issue ominous security warnings. 
     during installation. Your OS may require administrator privileges,
     to override the OS settings.  
  2. To install software, you must have an administrator
     account on your computer. And you must also be logged in 
     as the administor when installing. In Windows, especially, you may
     be required to install or run software in administrator mode. 
  3. Much open-source software will be available through GitHub
     or SourceForge and sometimes on web sites that may look dicey
     because they employ HTML frames and other design fads of the 1990s. Despite my
     advice that you trust me, SourceForge is a private company that
     has been known to take advantage of newbie users.
     See [SourceForge Warning](http://www.gluster.org/2013/08/how-far-the-once-mighty-sourceforge-has-fallen/ "SourceForge Warning").
     I will try to warn you of potential pitfalls,
     but I encourage you to warn one another if you encounter problems.
     GitHub is today used more widely than SourceForge for distribution of
     open source software.
  4. Open source software originally designed for UNIX OS
     may have less support for mouse, may demand a whole arsenal
     of arcane commands, may be supported by rather hard-nosed tutorials,
     and may offer almost no immediate rewards during first hours of use,
     first days of use, or even first weeks of use. That is, several
     hours of work are needed to achieve minimal competence. If you've never
     dealt with command line software before, this will take a while.
     It takes effort to achieve reasonable competence with LaTeX, PanDoc, Vim Text Editor, GitHub,
     etc. How long did it take me? 4 mos., 3 weeks, 2 mos., 1 week, etc. For most routines,
     I will provide basic step-by-step instructions. You will need to follow them
     exactly and/or to adapt for your particular setup. I cannot predict 
     everything, so contact me rather than struggling fruitlessly for several
     hours. 
  5. Operating Systems:
     *  Apple Macintosh, you should be on Snow Leopard, Snow Lion,
     or Maverick. You may install and run UNIX-based software on Macintosh, which
     has been a UNIX OS for several years. Often, such as for Vim, you may have 
     a choice of a UNIX-style version (shipped with OS) and a ported
     Macintosh version that you can download from a separate web site,
     which will have better support for usual Macintosh interface and user behaviors. 
     *  MS Windows, you should be on Windows 7 or later. Windows XP is
     no longer supported.  Windows Vista is generally OK, but it
     is fading in use. 
     *  UNIX implementations like Ubuntu or Red Hat for laptop or
     desktop system. Any modern UNIX implementation should work fine. 
     But you are on your own, like always.
     *  Apple or Android Tablets, Google Chrome, etc. These are not supported,
     and I have no idea whether you can do the work using them. I have no
     recommendations for OS-level hacking, emulation, dual boot modes, etc.  
  6. I am not a trained computer troubleshooters or technicians.
     For software, contact [http://support.kent.edu](http://support.kent.edu "KSU Helpdesk"). For
     virus and component repair, contact
     [http://www2.kent.edu/is/support/thetechspot/index.cfm](http://www2.kent.edu/is/support/thetechspot/index.cfm "The TechSpot").
     Your professor is a reasonably proficent technical user who is able
     to complete rudimentary scripting tasks. I do OK, for an English professor.  

## Managing Your Own Web Identity and Projects


## About Pandoc

Pandoc is described as a "Universal Document Converter." You
can use it to convert from about 15 source formats to
about 25 destination formats, though many source formats
are flavors of markdown and many destination formats rely
on interaction with LaTex. For installation instructions,
see John McFarlane's page at
(http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html)[http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html].
MacFarlane's web site has a brief introduction to command line
(Pandoc Tutorial). The intriguing promise of Pandoc is that
work produced in an easily preserved format like plain text
(with simple plain text markup) can be transformed to
other formats.

### Install Pandoc on Windows
 - Download and install
   pandoc-1.12.4.X.X-windows.msi (accept latest stable version
   numbers that substitute for X's in file name)
 - On the Open File - Security Warning, click Run and, if necessary, 
   override with the Administrator password.
 - Accept all default installation settings.
 - Note: After you install Pandoc, nothing happens. There is
   no "application" or "shortcut." Pandoc must be invoked from
   the command line, preferably PowerShell.
 - For LaTeX and PDF output, also see "Install LaTeX."


### Install Pandoc on Macintosh
 - Download and install
   pandoc-1.12.4.X.X-osx.zip (accept latest stable version
   numbers that substitute for X's in file name)
 - During installation, accept license agreement and default installation settings,
   and enter your Administrator password when prompted.
 - Note: After you install Pandoc, nothing happens. There is
   no GUI application shortcut to add to the Dock. Pandoc
   must be invoked from
   the command line, the "Terminal." 
 - For LaTeX and PDF output, also see "LaTeX."

## About LaTeX

LaTeX is the most widely used implementation of the TeX
typesetting system. TeX was created by a famed Stanford computer
scientist, Donald Knuth. After he was annoyed by poor
publisher typesetting of his book, he created the
typesetting program TeX, which has become the dominant
typesetting system for math and science papers. For several decades, 
Knuth famously offered cash rewards to anyone who identified an
error in his books (see the Wikipedia entry). 

The "La" in LaTex refers to Leslie Lamport, who created a
typesetting environment (soups to nuts) approach for 
typesetting with TeX. Lamports add-on macros organize documents
according to structure (document parts like title, subtitle,
author, section) rather than typographic markup (as TeX does).

The vocabulary to describe LaTeX programs sounds a bit arcane today
because many of its conventions are over 30 years old. It is available 
in "distributions" (full-fledged TeX and
LaTeX installation routines suitable for UNIX mainframes and
for personal computers), and distributions consist of a series
of "packages" to support various activities. The term "distribution"
is reasonably similar to today's "application," and the term
"package" is reasonably similar to an "add-on." 


### Install LaTeX on Windows

1. Go to the MikTeX downloads site [http://miktex.org/download](http://miktex.org/download ).
   The current version is 2.9.XXXX (accept latest stable version
   numbers that substitute for X's in file name)
2. Select the option best suited for your operating system and
   connection:
   - If you have 32-bit Windows and a fast (on campus) connection,
     select "Basic MikTeX Installer (32-bit)."
   - (Other Downloads) If you have 64-bit Windows and a fast
     (on campus) connection, select "Basic MikTeX Installer (64-bit)."
3. If you are in a desperate hurry or have limited space on hard
   drive and must download from off campus, select the appropriate
   Net Installer.
4. 





### Reclaim Hosting

[Reclaim Hosting](http://portal.reclaimhosting.com/index.php "The TechSpot"). This
service at \$12 per year in 2014 (to rise to \$25), allows you to have your own WordPress, Omeka and many other
types of sites. For your group project, you will need to have one
member of your group sign up and serve as the administrator for your web
hosting service. 

As a group, in exchange for on person paying for and serving as the administrator, 
others  should agree to do something in return for hosting your project for one year,
which amounts to the equivalent of a \$5 of in-kind academic labor
or good (perhaps two cofees?). 

The administrator must install WordPress and Omeka or other services,
but the site administrator can grant full control (administrator rights)
to another user who manages WordPress or Omeka installation.  
     

### WordPress

## Plain Text Editors
   
Use a plain text editor instead of a word 
processor when preparing text-based documents. Word processors 
(Microsoft Word, Google Documents, OpenOffice Writer, and Apple Pages)
create documents with elaborate coding to achieve WYSWYG layout,
and such encoding is often discarded when translating into plain text
documents.  Learning all the quirks of an individual word processor is a less valuable skill 
than learning to encode plain text documents that can be
easily ported from one operating system and one processing system to another.
The latter is a goal of this course.  Another course
goal is to reduce your dependence on a single application and
alter your understanding of the relationship between text and format.
Both these capabilities are valuable for professions in which you have to prepare documentation
and analyze data. I do not care which of the following
plain text editors you use, but Vi and emacs are entire worlds of their own, into which
considerable immersion is necessary to achieve basic competence.  But they
are very powerful and very widely used. You should review your
chosen editor's support and implementation of regular expressions (REGEX).
This tongue-in-cheek graphic illustrates comparative learning
curves [Manuel's Web Pages: Text Editors](http://www.manuelmagic.me/geek/texteditors/ "http://www.manuelmagic.me/geek/texteditors/").


### Vi Improved (Vim), for UNIX, Macintosh, and Windows
  * Download: [Vim Installer](http://www.vim.org/ "Vim Home Page with Links to Installers"). 
    Select the appropriate executable installer for Windows or Mac (MacVim), and
    follow instructions for installation.
  * Complete the basic online tutorial (browser-based VIM emulation) at
    [Open Vim](http://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html "Tutorial"). 
  * Within actual VIM, complete the vimtutor. 1) Open VIM, 2) Click <ESC>. 3) Type 
    "vimtutor" (exclude quote marks) and press <Return>. If that does not work, type 
    ":help vimtutor" and follow the instructions. Or, type ":echo \$VIMRUNTIME" to figure
    out where vimtutor is located. Typically, it's located in "tutor" folder within
    the $VIMRUNTIME location.  For browser-based emulation of text file, see
    [vimtutor](http://www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~plewis/teaching/unix/vimtutor
    "Vim Tutorial"). To "read" the tutorial here is not enough. Complete
    each exercise within VIM, about 45 minutes. 
 *   For higher proficiency, see
     [Daniel Miessler, VIM Tutorial and Primer](http://www.danielmiessler.com/study/vim/ "Daniel Miessler, VIM Tutorial and Primer") And see [Laurent Grégoire, VIM Quick Reference](http://tnerual.eriogerg.free.fr/vimqrc.pdf "Laurent Grégoire, VIM Quick Reference")

## Working Together

Working together is difficult, but you will be working in teams. And you need
to develop routines to ensure that you can work together efficiently. The
only required tool will be GitHub, which you will use to manage your
source text documents, but you may also use other tools to
organize your collaboration with other members of your team.
