OCR on Macintosh with Tesseract Engine

1.  From the Mac App Store, download and install Xcode 
    (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835)
    This takes a long time. If you don't have an Apple ID, you
    must set up an Apple ID to download the "free" application.
    After ID set up, click "Free" to start installation. 
    Brew pot of coffee, read a novel, and check if 
    "Installing" has completed.
    
2.  After Xcode completes the App Store install, search for
    Xcode in Searchlight (by default, it is place
    in "Applications" directory). When first launching Xcode, allow
    installation of additional components. 
    
3. Open Xcode, and select Preferences from Xcode menu. Under Components
   section of Downloads, select and install Command Line Tools. 

4.  After Xcode is installed, on the Macports page (https://www.macports.org), 
    click "Installing Macports" and select the appropriate version for your operating system.

5.  Download and install the Macports package.

6.  Launch the Terminal, and enter the following command:

    sudo port install tesseract-eng
    
    Note: If you wish another language, repeat with another one. If tesseract fails
    to install and the terminal issues a warning message, read it. Most likely, you need
    to go back and install (or complete the install of) xCode or Macports. 
    The command "sudo port install" will only install tesseract if the two 
    other applications are previously installed. In computer
    speak, Xcode and Macports are dependencies.
