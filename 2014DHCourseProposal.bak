# A New Course in English: Digital Humanities

I apply for a Summer Teaching Development Grant to create a new course
for the Department of English, an introduction to digital humanities.
The formal number and name would be "ENG 39395, ST: Intro to Digital
Humanities." Because the course will be designated a special topic (ST),
the pre-requisite would be either College Writing 2 (ENG 21011) or
Honors Colloquium 2 (HONR 10297). The 15-week course would be open to
most second-year students and up.

# Description of Course 

The course will provide undergraduates an introduction to software for
text manipulation, to technical procedures for acquiring images and
texts, and to software for text visualization and digital publishing.
Because the final activity of the course will be a collaborative online
project, students will also be introduced to project-management tools,
public blogs, and exhibit software.

Like other humanities disciplines that fall outside the STEM fields, the
English department faces challenges to attract undergraduates to its
major and to its electives. The department would benefit if we could
extend opportunities for students to develop skill in widely used
open-access software. Students in undergraduate English courses
typically employ word processing (MS Word or Google Document) and
presentation software (MS PowerPoint or Google Presentation), but this
course will offer opportunities to expand technology skills to the
following tools: plain text editors and compilers, the UNIX operating
system, software for optical character recognition, text processing with
regular expressions (REGEX), online exhibit tools, concordances, and
text visualization software.

A second benefit of the course is that it will serve as a proving ground
for the revision of the graduate major, which will better qualify
students for diverse career options. The Graduate Literature faculty in
Fall 2013 met on proposals to offer MA "tracks" or certificates. One
proposed track would be in editing and publishing, disciplinary areas
from which digital humanities originated in English departments. The
skills of digital humanities are useful to a wider range of employers
and likewise for digital editorial work. Faculty in the KSU English
Department have long collaborated with the Institute for Bibliography
and Editing (IBE) and the KSU Press, and this course will help develop a
cohort of undergraduates with skills to contribute to digital humanities
projects. Digital humanities also offers the English department an
opportunity to break down barriers between literary study and rhetoric
and composition, a traditional dividing line in English as a scholarly
discipline, and to collaborate with outside units including Library
Special Collections. I hope also to attract to the course several
students from Computer Science or from the College of Digital Science
who seek a humanities elective.

#  Goals 

The goals for students in "ENG 39395, ST: Intro to Digital
Humanities" are the following: 1) to acquire basic digital literacy
skills (text and image acquisition, text encoding, image processing,
text processing) that undergird web-based technology; 2) to become
cognizant of the challenges of reproducing cultural artifacts and to
become aware that some benefits of digitization, such as access, depend
on types of translation that include the risk of damaging original
artifacts or not fully representing some qualities of original
documents; 3) to develop project management and collaboration skills
that are required for significant web-based projects; 4) to develop
interpersonal skills and communication techniques for approaching and
systematically addressing challenges that impede progress in group-based
technology projects; 5) to achieve awareness of the responsibilities
that developers of public projects have for crediting sources and for
ensuring access by diverse audiences; and 6) to develop a professional
public identity that is associated with a web project and with
associated class materials (blog posts, tweets) on an openly accessible
web site.

My goal is to use my experience in digital humanities projects and my
contacts in the wider community of digital humanities scholars to better
serve KSU students. Because most of my scholarship has been for
individual projects, I want to explore through pedagogy the core
principles that are shared across scholarly disciplinesâ€”an aim in
keeping with digital humanities as an interdisciplinary practice. I hope
to support the English department's effort to re-shape its majors, both
undergraduate and graduate, and to better prepare students for work in
technology- and information-based industries. The course will serve also
as a workshop to reinvigorate the Institute for Bibliography and Editing
(IBE) as a student lab. I have been nominated to serve the IBE as the
incoming director, and I want to transform it into a student digital
humanities lab and a center for interdisciplinary collaboration. Also in
furtherance of collaboration with scholars from other disciplines, I
plan to resuscitate the Digital Humanities Reading and Working (DHRWG)
group, an informal faculty colloquium which during 2012--2013 academic
year was able to draw faculty in English, history, library science and
the library to monthly meetings The group will be re-formed as a setting
to invite scholars interested in digital humanities disciplines to share
their work and to explore digital humanities pedagogy. I also aim to
prod campus information services to provide greater technology support
for faculty classroom projects outside the Blackboard course management
system. If scholarship and pedagogy are to be publicly accessible, they
cannot be buried within a course management system.

#  Impact 

The pilot version of the course will be designed for 24 students and
will support 4 student projects, with 2 or 3 projects devoted to
digitizing Special Collections materials and 1 or 2 projects to IBE
materials. I have proposed a version of the course for the 2014--2015
academic year, and I would teach the course in the spring. Robert
Walker, Director of the School for Digital Sciences, has expressed an
interest in such a course for his undergraduate students, and he advised
at a DHRWG meeting that students in his unit would be interested in
electives that allow exploration of digital representation for
humanities date. All activities will take place on the Kent Campus, with
a primary classroom assigned by the registrar and a faculty-staffed lab
that will be housed in the IBE. I will staff the optional lab time
myself because I receive a course release as the IBE director.

#  Activities and Timeline

## Week 1
 > Assess Digital Humanities undergraduate syllabi posted to Zotero
 > syllabus collection from Fall 2011 to the present (approx. 25) with
 > criteria identified by Lisa Spiro. From trends in DH instruction
 > that Spiro identified and newly emergent practices, locate model
 > exercises and instructional practices that have been tested in
 > classroom environments [@syllabizotero; @spiroknowing2011].

## Week 2
 > Create course web site by installing WordPress and Omeka instance on
 > personal web server. I have used WordPress previously, and I am
 > using Omeka during the Spring 2014 semester with a student research
 > assistant [@RosenzweigCHNM] Post first draft syllabus with readings
 > and draft exercises.

## Week 3
 > Prepare exercises for weeks 2--4 of course. I plan to introduce plain
 > text editors, the distinction between text as information and as
 > formal features of presentation, and compilers that transform
 > encoded textual data for different computing applications. The tool
 > for text creation is a free text editor, either TextWrangler
 > (Macintosh) or NoteTab++ (Windows). The transformation tools are
 > Pandoc and LaTeX. The exercises will include the following: 1) using
 > a text editor to prepare a document in MarkDown format, 2) using
 > Pandoc to transform the MarkDown-encoded text to RTF (for word
 > processors), to LaTeX, and to HTML, 3) using LaTeX document to
 > generate PDF, and 4) posting Pandoc-generated HTML documents to
 > course web site [@MacFarlane2013; @TheLaTeX3Project2014].

## Week 4
 > Prepare exercises for weeks 5--7 of the course. The activities will
 > include acquiring text via optical character recognition of scanned
 > printed pages, entering text at high rates of accuracy with
 > double-key keyboard transcription, and acquiring text through
 > open-access text repositories (&lt;[http://archive.org](http://archive.org)&gt;,
 > &lt;[http://chroniclingamerica.org](http://chroniclingamerica.org)&gt;, etc.). Software tools will include
 > optical character recognition software, plain text editors, and two
 > types of software for identifying differences between filesâ€”file
 > comparison software (WinMerge [Windows], KDiff3 [Mac]) and scholarly
 > collation software (JUXTA, web client).

## Week 5
 > Visit Special Collections to assess suitability of following
 > collections for classroom digitization: Helen Adam correspondence
 > with James Broughton and Alfred Chester papers. These collections
 > were recommended as candidates by Special Collections Director Cara
 > Gilgenbach [@gilgenbach2014]. Also I will visit IBE
 > to assess for digitization of the covers from the Joseph Conrad
 > Collection of editions, about 100 editions. And continue development
 > of week 5--7 exercises.

## Week 6
 > Consult with Special Collections Librarian Cara Gilgenbach to
 > prepare draft procedures for student digitization of special
 > collections resources (standards, procedures, reserve hours,
 > in-class lab at IBE or Special Collections). Continue suitability
 > assessment with Richard Austin Freeman Correspondence and Thornton
 > Wilder papers. Also review Charles W. Chesnutt edition covers
 > (Special Collections).

## Week 7
 > Prepare exercises for weeks 8--10 of the course during the academic
 > semester. The activities will include manipulating text with REGEX
 > commands, preparing concordances (*AntConc*
 > (&lt;[http://www.antlab.sci.waseda.ac.jp/software.html](http://www.antlab.sci.waseda.ac.jp/software.html)&gt;,
 > multi-platform), and publishing word clouds (*Voyant Tools*
 > [&lt;[http://voyant-tools.org/](http://voyant-tools.org/)&gt;, Web]). Also, review scholarly web
 > project standards for editions of letters and for collections of
 > publisher bindings. Select or compose student-suitable guidelines
 > for transcription, annotation, text analysis, digital image
 > acquisition, and digital file management.

## Week 8
 > Prepare draft guidelines for student project, and select readings on
 > project management, online accessibility, and web design. The
 > student project section of the course will occupy weeks 8--14 during
 > an academic semester (which in course will intersect with less
 > demanding activities on concordances and word cloud visualization).

## Week 9
 > Post completed syllabus with linked readings and guidelines, and use
 > Twitter and email to contact DH colleagues to seek commentary and
 > recommendations. I will also contact DH colleagues at other campuses
 > to gauge interest in guest visits or collaboration. Prepare student
 > questionaires to evaluate effectiveness of 1) text-manipulation and
 > text acquisition training, 2) IBE and Special Collections resources
 > for software and image scanning, 3) procedures for acquisition of
 > digital images and texts, 4) assigned readings, and 5) project
 > management tools and procedures.

## Week 10
 > Revise syllabus, revise assignments, and prepare promotional flyers
 > to be posted in the English Department, Honors College, Computer
 > Science department, and School of Digital Humanities.

# Communication Plan

I intend to share the results of this project with professional
colleagues in three ways. First I will share the course with DHRWG
colleagues, and I will also present to the UTC Conference. Second, I
will share updates on the course with approximately one hundred
colleagues in digital humanities (blog at &lt;[http://wraabe.wordpress.com](http://wraabe.wordpress.com)&gt;
and Twitter \(\@wraabe\). I dedicate myself to tweeting weekly on the
course development and to posting a minimum of two 1000-word in-progress
assessments during the process of course development (week 3, week 8)
and one 2500-word final assessment at the conclusion of ten weeks.
Third, I will post at least one of these assessments on *Vitae*
(&lt;[https://chroniclevitae.com/](https://chroniclevitae.com/)&gt; or *HASTAC* &lt;[http://www.hastac.org/](http://www.hastac.org/)&gt;).
These assessment activities will serve as my draft proposal for UTC
Conference, and the conference presentation will serve as a draft
article on the experience of developing and teaching this course. I will
also watch for conference presentation opportunities at any of the
various THATCamp (&lt;[http://thatcamp.org](http://thatcamp.org)&gt;) or language and literature
conferences. I recently submitted an article (Jan. 2014) on teaching
with digital humanities tools in the undergraduate classroom to the
journal of the College English Association, the *CEA Critic*, and I plan
to re-visit those topics in an article for the open-access journal
*Digital Humanities Quarterly* (*DHQ*).

# Evaluation Plan 

At the conclusion of course development, I will issue requests for
comments to selected colleagues with experience in undergraduate digital
humanities courses. I will prepare an evaluation questionnaire derived
from SSI form questions about student learning and skills, and I will
offer a small honoraria (\$50 gift cards) to two colleagues who are
willing to review the finished syllabus and exercises. I will also ask
KSU colleague Derek Van Ittersum (English), who has also expressed an
interest in developing a DH course, to review the finished course.
During the semester in which offered, I will ask my chair Robert Trogdon
to schedule an in-class assessment with two colleagues from the
department. At the conclusion of the course, I will prepare my own
750-word assessment of the effectiveness of the teaching materials and
the project guidelines, one which is based on student performance and
student surveys. I will include those assessments with my annual
reappointment file. The assessment will be posted on my blog and (as
applicable) will be added to the *DHQ* article. I will propose a minimum
of three recommendations for improving the course in a future semester.
At the recommendation of colleague Van Ittersum, who is concerned that
undergraduates will not be able to manage eXtensible Markup Language
(XML), I have not included XML. Therefore, I will assess week 5--7
activities based on student response to determine whether it is feasible
in a revised course to substitute a unit on XML and XSLT (technologies
used in scholarly publishing) for the unit on REGEX, concordances, and
visualization.

# Professional Background 

I have training in scholarly editing and American literature, and I have
published digital editions on *Uncle Tom's Cabin & American Culture*
(&lt;[http://utc.iath.virginia.edu/](http://utc.iath.virginia.edu/)&gt;) and the online journal *Scholarly
Editing* (&lt;[http://www.scholarlyediting.org/](http://www.scholarlyediting.org/)&gt;). I have forthcoming on the
*Walt Whitman Archive* (&lt;[http://whitmanarchive.org](http://whitmanarchive.org)&gt; [March? 2014]) a
collection of letters to Walt Whitman from his mother Louisa Van Velsor
Whitman. I have also served as a project manager on the *William Blake
Archive* (&lt;[http://www.blakearchive.org/](http://www.blakearchive.org/)&gt;) and *Civil War Washington*
(&lt;[http://civilwardc.org/](http://civilwardc.org/)&gt;). I am currently working with an undergraduate
student on an independent study, which will include an Omeka Exhibit. I
have the scholarly background in digital humanities and the technical
skills to do these tasks, but I want to acquire the pedagogical
expertise to train students in such fields. I plan during the course
development process to refresh technical skills, some of which have
begun to atrophy from irregular use. The skills that are needed to train
students in digital humanities have not been practiced, so the Summer
Teaching Development Grant offers an opportunity to work systematically
at preparing myself to train students and to support their project work.
