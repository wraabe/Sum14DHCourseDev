<h2 id="general-tips">General Tips</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In past 3 years, modern OS releases have added hurdles if you seek to install software from non-approved vendors. The warnings typically invoke viruses or security concerns. Open-source software, generally maintained by academics, has been around longer, relies on volunteer labor, and is not going to start jumping through vendor hoops. Therefore, when installing open source software, you may be warned or forced to take extra steps.</li>
<li>To install software, you must have an administrator account on your computer. And you must also be logged in as the administor when installing. In Windows, especially, you may be required to install or run software in administrator mode.</li>
<li>Much open-source software will be available through GitHub or SourceForge and sometimes on web sites that look dicey to you because they still employ frames and fonts out of 1990s. SourceForge is a private company, and it may try to take advantage of newbie users. <a href="http://www.gluster.org/2013/08/how-far-the-once-mighty-sourceforge-has-fallen/" title="SourceForge Warning">SourceForge Warning</a> I will try to warn you of potential pitfalls, but I encourage you to warn one another if you encounter problems. One risk is that by end of course, 90s-style web sites with no dancing graphics may seem kind of cool to you. GitHub is generally more widely used today.</li>
<li>Likewise, open source UNIX-based software may have less support for mouse, may demand whole arsenal of arcane commands, may have minimal availability of handholding tutorials, and offer almost no immediate rewards during first hours of use, first days of use, or even first weeks of use. That is, expect 20 hours of struggle to reach minimal competence. Ask me about how long it took to achieve basic competence with LaTeX, PanDoc, Vim Text Editor, GitHub, etc.</li>
<li>Operating Systems:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Apple Macintosh, you should be on Snow Leopard, Snow Lion, or Maverick. You may install UNIX-based software on Macintosh, which has been a UNIX OS for several years.</li>
<li>MS Windows, you should be on Windows 7 or later. Windows XP or Vista are not supported.</li>
<li>UNIX implementations like Ubuntu, Red Hat for laptop or desktop system. Any modern UNIX implementation should work fine. But you're on your own, like always.</li>
<li>Apple or Android Tablets, Google Chrome, etc. I have no recommendations for OS-level hacking, emulation, dual boot modes, etc. In the end, I am still an English professor.<br /></li>

</ol>
<ul>
<li>Download: <a href="http://www.vim.org/" title="Vim Home Page with Links to Installers">Vim Installer</a>. Select appropriate executable installer for Windows or Mac (MacVim).</li>
<li>Follow instructions for installation.</li>
<li>Complete the basic online tutorial (browser-based VIM emulation) at <a href="http://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html" title="Tutorial">Open Vim</a>.</li>
<li>Within actual VIM, complete the vimtutor. 1) Open VIM, 2) Click <ESC>. 3) Type &quot;vimtutor&quot; (exclude quote marks) and press <Return>. If that does not work, type &quot;:help vimtutor&quot; and follow the instructions. Or, type &quot;:echo <span class="math">$VIMRUNTIME&quot; to figure     out where vimtutor is located. Typically, it's located in &quot;tutor&quot; folder within     the $</span>VIMRUNTIME location. For browser-based emulation of text file, see <a href="http://www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~plewis/teaching/unix/vimtutor" title="Vim Tutorial">vimtutor</a>. To &quot;read&quot; the tutorial here is not enough. Complete each exercise within VIM, about 45 minutes.</li>
