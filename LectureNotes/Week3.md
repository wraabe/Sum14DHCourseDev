[comment]: # (How does one distinguish between form---the technological underpinnings or matters of presentation---and content---the stuff for interpretation? If we suppose we can distinguish between form and content, is that a useful step, or are we likely to deceive ourselves by taking such distinctions for granted? Could the distinction between form and content be both useful for some purposes and deceptive for others? We will explore this question by preparing a document in Markdown format, which will then be converted to forms suitable for alternate means of publication: print document, blog, and ebook. )
