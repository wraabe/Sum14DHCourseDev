[comment]: # (When working with humanities material, we often need to acquire text. While many documents are available online, in some cases, the text that we need to acquire are not. For our final project, with archival letters, we are the ones who plan to make them available to others. Therefore, we want to be familiar with automated techniques to acquire text. We shall also gain a greater familiarity with some qualities of archival materials, which are often viewed as “faulty” or “inadequate” for machine processing. We continue our concern with whether there is a useful distinction between the form of archival documents and their linguistic content. )
