Some installation or update routines for open source software
require you to have an Administrator account or to run routines
in Administrator mode. 

If you do not have access to an Administrator account, you may
be denied permission to access certain files, install applications
or run applications. 

If your computer is infected with viruses or compromised, it is
more dangerous if the user accesses an administrator account. Therefore,
most software security and default setup includes an administrator account that is used
only occasionally, such as when installing software or performing
other processes that require Administrator rights.


## Administrator Account Passwords


   To have an Administrator account on your computer, an account
   that has Administrator privileges must set up a new Admnistrator account
   or grant your current account Administrator privileges.

   An administrator account should have a difficult password to crack.
   If you will only use it rarely, write it down on some random place
   that will not be easily identifiable as the administrator account
   on your computer.
   
   I recommend that you follow the recommendation of Neil O'Farrell,
   a computer security expert who recommends a passphrase, a password
   constructed from a series of words that are meaningful to you and 
   from which you derive a long password with special characters,
   
   Phrase: "She dwelt among the untrodden ways."
   Password: sDaM_nguTdn*ys
   
   The password advice is based on this post.

## Working in Administrator Mode

   To have an Administrator account on your computer, an account
   that has Administrator privileges must set up a new Admnistrator account
   or grant your current account Administrator privileges.
   
   For details on Administrator privileges on
   Macintosh OSX, see (http://support.apple.com/kb/PH10882?viewlocale=en\_US)[http://support.apple.com/kb/PH10882?viewlocale=en\_US].
   
   For details on Administrator privileges on Windows,
   see (http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-users-account-type#1TC=windows-7)[http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-users-account-type#1TC=windows-7]

   Remember, it is a security risk to work always in an Administrator account. Generally,
   it is better to complete a task that requires Administrator access and then return
   to your usual method. If you will work regularly in Administrator mode,
   you should have strong automatic backup routines as well as firewalls and
   virus protection.
