## Paul Fyfe, Fall 2011, Florida State, Intro to Digital Humanities, 

 - A ``grad seminar": calls for ``fortitude'';
 - Almost all online, almost all articles linked on syllabus 
 - Hockey and Kirschenbaum on history; Unsworth and Flanders on unease; Ramsay on Building; McGann and Hayles on encoding; Renear and Cohen-Rosenzweig on markup; Nell Smith and Mueller on Scholarly Editing; Darnton, Cecire, Werner on edition/archive and hypertext; PMLA on Whitman Archive; Dublin Core and Omeka; Ramsay on ``Algorithmic criticism"; Rockwell and Witmore on Text Mining and Analysis; Nunberg and Michel-Shen-Aiden-Veres-Gray on digitized books; Cohen, Manovich, and Nowviskie on data; Bodenhamer, Corrigan, Harris, eds., on *Spatial Humanities* (e.g., GIS collection) and Croxall on timelines
 - Very similar to what I might want to undertake, scaled down for undergraduates,  

## Shannon Carter, TAMU, Summer 2013, Graduate 

 - More of a critical reading class for DH in scholarship and teaching; a project ends it, but how to do (or what to do for) the project not very clear on syllabus
 - Spiro, Getting Started, [http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-1/getting-started-in-digital-humanities-by-lisa-spiro/ ()] *Journal of DH* 1:1 (2011)


## Amanda French, GMU, HIST 390, GMU, Digital Past
 - Excellent syllabus policies on plagiarism in DH work and citing non-text sources like images. 
 - Introduces basic computing concepts: See Cohen and Rosenzweig, WordPress, 
 - Intriguing articles: Errol Morris, on hacking and passwords, Google KML maps;
   Tufte on Powerpoint and Norvig, Gettysburg Powerpoint,  
 - Scratch is very intriguing as a DH project. See page 7. 
 - Also see List of DH resources, [http://amandafrench.net/2010/11/18/introduction-to-digital-humanities/](http://amandafrench.net/2010/11/18/introduction-to-digital-humanities/ "[http://amandafrench.net/2010/11/18/introduction-to-digital-humanities/")
 - And see Cohen, Daniel J. and Roy Rosenzweig, *Digital History: A Guide to Gathering Preserving, and Presenting the Past on the Web*  [http://chnm.gmu.edu/digitalhistory/](http://chnm.gmu.edu/digitalhistory/ "http://chnm.gmu.edu/digitalhistory/") See, especially, ``Becoming Digital" and ``Designing for the History Web" 

## Birnbaum, David, Digital Humanities, University of Pittsburgh, Computational Methods in the Humanities
 - Uses oXygen, SSH Shell (Windows), Fetch, and GitHub
 - Provides his own ``even gentler" introduction to XML, in which
 he defines fundamental DH as 1) ``creation of electronic
 texts" for purposes that cannot be undertaken without computer assistance,
 2) use of computational tools for original research results, 3)
 development of original programs if 2 do not meet needs.  And overall
 is a brilliant introduction.
 - Drupal
 - A serious introduction to XML, HTML, CSS, XPATH, XSLT, REGEX, XQuery, JavaScript, 


## Croxall, Bryan, Digital Humanities (Spring 2014), Emory

 also see Teresa N. Washington, chapter 6 *Manifestations of Masculine Magnificence: Divinity in Africana Life, Lyrics* 226--256.
 - The ``A Million Blue Pages" looks interesting, but I think I'd rather try with WordPresss plug-in for Ivanhoe at  [http://ivanhoe.scholarslab.org/index.html(http://ivanhoe.scholarslab.org/index.html "http://ivanhoe.scholarslab.org/index.html")
